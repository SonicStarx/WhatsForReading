Project Title - What is for reading this week?
What is the project about?
This project concerns the design and implementation of an Internet application which assists primary school teachers in assigning appropriate book(s) for each pupil to read.

Primary school pupils are often assigned books each week to read to help develop their reading ability and promote the habit of reading. In some primary schools, pupils are failing to be at the national recommended reading level for their year, in particular, the Reception year. 

KS1 (Key Stage 1) is a very important year to set the foundation of pupilâ€™s skills to support them for the remainder of their educational journey. Because of this, the web application will have a focus on supporting KS1 pupils.
